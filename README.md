### Premier League Dataset

# Project Overview

The Premier League is often considered one of the best football leagues in the world. Known for its competitiveness and unpredictability, the Premier League provides fans around the world with weekly entertaining fixtures throughout its nine-month long season. 

In the 2017-2018 Premier League season, Manchester City Football Club were crowned English champions as they had a record breaking season; accumulating over 100 points. This is a feat accomplished by some of the best clubs across Europe such as Real Madrid in 2011-2012, Barcelona in 2012-2013, and Juventus in 2013-2014 to name a few.

We will be analyzing data from the 2017-2018 Premier League season to further understand how a massive achievement was secured.
